# Word-Game

For both levels I scoured through the levels testing for the right word to base the level off of. I finally found one with enough words that I could set a point goal, but that forced the player to strategize so they could reach the target objective. The second level I picked a level with few words, but so that the player had to strategise to get the fewest possible points. It was kinda fun picking through the levels for these features

This was probably the worst job I did paying attention to the code I was typing from the book, and as a result I did a poor job understanding the structure of the code which ultimately hurt me in the end. I feel like if I took the time I wouldn't have ran into the bugs that I didn't fix in time for my submission. However, I think what I did learn was fun, and I liked the new features about Unity I learned (even though I'm starting to get a little sick of it haha)

Although I'm not particularly happy with my final work, I'm glad I at least have something to submit. I am ready for Thanksgiving break, and to get started on the group project.
